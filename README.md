# KALE - Keegan's Awful Lite Editor

I love **Nano/Micro**, I wanted to love **NeoVim**, but couldn't ‚Äî so I made my own text editor called **K.A.L.E.**, or _Keegan's Awful Lite Editor_.
Am I now realising I could've played with config files in NeoVim? Yes.
Am I now too committed to this project to switch and admit I'm wrong? Also yes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current State

**Massively unfinished**, but surprisingly functional. Has some degree of syntax highlighting for quite a few languages.

KALE is **Open Source**, but I'm not really in a position to accept contributions to the code at the moment. This is a small project I work on when I feel like it.
