# kale-text-editor
I love Nano, I wanted to love Vim, but couldn't so I made my own text editor called K.A.L.E. or "Keegan's Awful Lite Editor".

Contact info : cautiousdollop@protonmail.com

Current state - Massively Unfinished, but surprisingly functional.
KALE is Open Source, but I'm not in a position to accept contributions to the code at the moment as this is just a small project I sometimes work on if I feel like it.

Installation instructions:
  1. mv kale.py kale
  2. chmod +x kale
  3. sudo mv kale /usr/local/bin/kale
     OR FOR SINGLE USER
     mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
     mv kale ~/.local/bin/kale
  4. export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
  5. source ~/.bashrc
  6. Type "kale test.txt" and make sure it works.
  7. Figure out how to escape my Vim clone.

Better Control documentation comming soon... Mouse use is still very basic. There are plenty more controls I just need to fully write down what each thing does.

Controls
Kale operates in two main modes: COMMAND mode (for navigation and actions) and WRITE mode (for text editing). Switch between them with the Spacebar. Hereâ€™s the full breakdown of keybindings and mouse interactions:

General Controls
These work in both modes unless specified.

Spacebar: Enter WRITE mode from COMMAND mode.

Ctrl+S: Save the file.
Ctrl+Q: Quit the editor.
Ctrl+Z: Undo the last change.
Ctrl+Y: Redo the last undone change.

WRITE Mode - Used for basic writing tasks, has most functionality of a regular text-editor
